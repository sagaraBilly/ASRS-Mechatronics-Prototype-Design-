#Feel free to look and copy some of the parts BUT PLEASE DO NOT COPY ALL THE CONTENTS AS IT IS WITHOUT CONSENT
#This is indicated only for people to see, learn, pick some certain parts to be implemented

This repository shares the Arduino code that I made for designing a prototype of AS/RS machine [Automated Storage and Retrieval System].  
It is a single code that includes all the controls of both sensors and actuators. 

1 File Program consists of three sections;
- define stage (defining pins, etc)
- initial stage (setting initial value)
- loop stage (main contents : input and output process)

Hardware Spesification used:
Arduino Mega2560
RAMP 1.4
NEMA 17
3 Limit Switches
Keypad
RFID
LCD Display
Push Buttons

For more details on the design and test results, please see the research publication report.
